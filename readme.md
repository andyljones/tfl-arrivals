This is the source for a tiny website that reports live arrivals at a given tube station. [Here's an example for Brixton station](andyljones.github.io/tfl-arrivals).

To make your own website for your own station, fork the `gh-pages` branch and change the `STATION_ID` variable in
`index.html` to the ID of your station. The ID for a station can be found via [the TfL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). Your website will then be automatically hosted at `username.github.io/tfl-arrivals`
